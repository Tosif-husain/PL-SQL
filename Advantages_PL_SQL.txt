Advantages of PL/SQL

1) PL/SQLis development tool that not only supports SQL data manipulation but also provides 
   facilities of conditional checking, branching and looping.
2) PL/SQL sends an entire block of SQL statements to the oracle engine all in one go.
   Communication between the program block and the oracle engine reduces considerably,
   reducing network traffic.
   Since the Oracle engine got the SQL statements as a single block, it processes this code
   much faster than if it got the code one sentence at a time. There is a deinite improvement 
   in the performance time of the oracle engine. As an entire block of SQL code is passed to
   the Oracle engine at one time for execution, all changes made to the data in the table 
   are done or undone in one go.
3) PL/SQL also permits dealing with errors as required, and facilities displaying user-friendly
   messages when errors are encountered.
4) PL/SQL allows declaration and use of variables in blocks of code. These variables can be
   used to store intermediate results of a query for later processing, or calculate values
   and insert them into an Oracle table later. PL/SQL variables can be used anywhere, either in
   SQL statements or in PL/SQL blocks.
5) via PL/SQL, all sorts of calculations can be done quickly and efficiently without the use of
   the oracle engine. This considerably improves transaction performance.
6) Applications written in PL/SQL are portable to any computer hardware and operating system,
   where oracle is operational.
