The Generic PL/SQL Block

The Declare Section - DECLARE

Code blocks start with a declaration section, in which memory variables and
other oracle objects can be declared, and if required initialized.
Once declared, they can be used in SQL statements for data manipulation.
---Declaration of memory variables, constants, cursors etc. in PL/SQL

The Begin Section - BEGIN

It consists of a set of SQL and PL/SQL statements which describe processes that
have to be applied to table data. Actual data manipulation, looping and branching constructs
are specified in this section.
---SQL and PL/SQL executable statements

The Exception Section - EXCEPTION

This section deals with handling of errors that arise during execution of the data
manipulation statements, which make up the PL/SQL code block. Errors can arise due to
syntax, logic and/or validation rule violation.

The End Section - END

This marks the end of a PL/SQL block.
