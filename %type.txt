%TYPE Attribute

The %TYPE attribute lets you declare a data item of the same data type as a 
previously declared variable or column (without knowing what that type is). 
If the declaration of the referenced item changes, then the declaration of 
the referencing item changes accordingly.

The syntax of the declaration is:

referencing_item referenced_item%TYPE;


The referencing item inherits the following 
from the referenced item:

Data type and size
Constraints (unless the referenced item is a column)
The referencing item does not inherit the initial value 
of the referenced item. 
Therefore, if the referencing item specifies or inherits 
the NOT NULL constraint, 
you must specify an initial value for it.

The %TYPE attribute is particularly useful when
 declaring variables to hold database values. 
The syntax for declaring a variable of the 
same type as a column is:

variable_name table_name.column_name%TYPE;

Example:

DECLARE
  name     VARCHAR(25) NOT NULL := 'Smith';
  surname  name%TYPE := 'Jones';
BEGIN
  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('name=' || name);
  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('surname=' || surname);
END;
/
Result:

name=Smith
surname=Jones
