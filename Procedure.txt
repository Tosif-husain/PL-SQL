Write a procedure that takes as input the department number 
and passes two parameters – one giving the total number of employees 
in that department and the other giving the maximum salary in that department.
 
 

  CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE count_emp (
    d IN DEPT.DEPTNO%TYPE,
    tot OUT NUMBER,
    msal OUT NUMBER
) IS
BEGIN
    SELECT COUNT(*), MAX(SAL)
    INTO tot, msal
    FROM EMP
    WHERE DEPTNO = d;
END;








DECLARE
    no EMP.DEPTNO%TYPE;
    totl NUMBER(3);
    max_sal NUMBER(10);
BEGIN
    no := &no; -- Prompt user for department number
    count_emp(no, totl, max_sal);
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Total Employees: ' || totl || ' Maximum Salary: ' || max_sal);
END;
