1) Simple Loop

In simple loop, the keyword loop should be 
placed before the first statement
in the sequence and keyword end loop 
should be written at the end of the sequence
to end the loop.

Syntax:

loop
   <sequence of statements>
end loop;


2) While Loop

Syntax:

while <condition>
loop
    <action>
end loop;

3) For Loop

Syntax:

for variable in [reverse] start..end
loop
   <action>
end loop;

4) Sequential control

The GOTO statement:

The GOTO statement changes the flow of control within a PL/SQL block. This statement
allows execution of a section of code, which is not in the normal flow of control.
The entry point into such a block of code is marked using the tags <<userdefined name>>.
The GOTO statement can then make use of this user-defined name to jump into that block
of code for execution.

Syntax:

GOTO <codeblock name>;
